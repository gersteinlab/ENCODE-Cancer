###The central topics 

**Topic 1:** Integrated prioritization scheme form the group 

**Topic 2:** Potential for collaborating with experimental labs.

**Topic 3** Collaborating with ENCODE and GWAS


### Topic 3

* The main idea is that in a joint analysis we need consistent access to a unified data set. By submitting a joint applications we could get an expedited decision.

* Lot;s of discussion about weather we could share derived data (from the original data set) with in the group. The conclusion is that Mike Pazin will look into this.


### On the topic of what data sets we would be interested in analysing 

* we shared this doc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0ApNn9g05ykFNdENLeVZPU2s0NXhoczJLcHZLRXRNYXc&usp=drivesdk

* Mark mentioned that the CCLE is a really nice option. 2 brest and 2 lung samples that looked good.

* The conclusion is that we want to do some pan-something analysis and that it would be nice to be able to share derived data with the ENCODE GWAS group. 


### Topic 2

* People are generally excited about this, but nothing specific.
