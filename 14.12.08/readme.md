Presentaiton from Richard Sallari Manolis Kellis Lab MIT & Broad.

### Slide 2
we see a nice visual explaning the varius annotiaotn that are being intrgratied here


### Slide 3
So why use this many annotiations? often "patters" with strong biological "signal" has a weak genomics "signal"

So what we see here in this matric is an example of a possible bioligical signal 
that has a weak genimc signal.


### Slide 4

so these are some nice papers repotting some nice data sets that we;re using here


### Slide 5

we still need info about the chromitin states. 

open chromitin is kept seperate.

becuase of it;s diverse funciotion

we se that open chro has low mut reate (muts are fixed)
and that repressed and possied elms has hight mut rate


### Slide 6

regional heterogenity
it;s important to et an idea of the back group muiaton reate. 



### Slide 8

pelexus and tiles and stuff and wht the fffffff


number of tiles in each annotation catirogires

large number of tiels in a reions implies that that regio is hetero chromiatics. 


### Slide 9

so how do we permutaiton test. we do it by perumting hte pleis (plural?)



### Slide 10


all pleisis in a chrmistate 



### Slide 11

p-values are BH corrected 

### Slide 12-13-14

some really pritty picutres


### Slide 17

convergnce at the gene and pathway leven. 

so the quesiton remints after all fo the rigamorole are we finding stuff that is know 
to be incoled in cancer?

answer is yeah.

6 of the gene are connected to angrogen signalling (prostate imprattan)
