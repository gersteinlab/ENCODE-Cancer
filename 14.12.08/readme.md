Presentation from Richard Sallari, Manolis Kellis Lab MIT & Broad.

### Slide 2

We see a nice visual explaining the various annotation that are being integrated here.

### Slide 3

So why use this many annotations? often "patters" with strong biological "signal" has a weak genomic "signal".

So what we see here in this matrix is an example of a possible biological signal 
that has a weak genomic signal.

### Slide 4

So these are some nice papers repotting some nice data sets that we're using here

### Slide 5

we still need info about the chromatin states. 

open chromatin is kept separate because of its diverse function

we see that open chro has low mut rate (muts are fixed) and that repressed and poised elms has high mut rate


### Slide 6

regional heterogeneity and the idea of a background mutational model 


### Slide 8

number of tiles in each annotation categories

large number of tiles in a regions implies that that region is hetero chromatic. 


### Slide 9

so how do we permutation test. we do it by permuting the pleis (plural?)


### Slide 10

all plessis in a chrmistate 

### Slide 11

p-values are BH corrected 

### Slide 12-13-14

Nice visualizations

### Slide 17

We see convergence at the gene and pathway leven. 

so the question remains after all of the rigamarole are we finding stuff that is know 
to be involved in cancer? answer is yeah.

6 of the gene are connected to androgen signalling (prostate imprattan)
